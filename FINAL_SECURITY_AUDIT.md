# Final Security Audit Findings

## CONFIRMED ISSUES

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Refund System Redesigned (COMPLETED)
**File**: `/api/refund/route.ts`

**Issue**: Refund endpoint was user-facing with authentication issues and mismatched parameters.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- ✅ Removed all user-facing refund buttons and UI
- ✅ Converted `/api/refund` to admin-only automatic system
- ✅ Added proper authorization header validation
- ✅ Implemented automatic 7-day expiry logic
- ✅ Added on-chain refund execution via SimplifiedEscrow contract
- ✅ Updated UI to show "automatically refunds after 7 days" messaging

**Security Improvements**:
- No longer allows unauthorized refund requests
- Admin authentication required
- Automatic processing eliminates user manipulation
- Proper gas pricing and on-chain execution

### 2. Dead Code Cleanup (LOW)
**Files**: 
- `/api/claim/details/route.ts` 
- `/api/confirm-transfer/route.ts`

**Issue**: Unused legacy endpoints from old claim token system

**Evidence**: No references found in current codebase, current system uses different endpoints
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Recommendation**: Delete unused endpoints
